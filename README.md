## Moonshot

This is my code for the 2020 Github GameOff with the theme Moonshot. I wrote the engine from scratch using Java in OpenGL

## Folder Structure

The `src` folder has two packages

- `engine`: This is the engine I wrote on the day the Jam began using LWJGL
- `main`: This is where I will keep the real game logic for the Moonshot game.
